The delicious mixture of chopped juicy tomatoes, lemon juice, and fresh herbs—usually piled on top of bread—is pretty tough to beat. So our chefs decided to give it a delicious upgrade. This recipe swaps bread (which, let’s be honest, usually gets a bit soggy!) for golden, panko-and-mozzarella-coated chicken cutlets.

One bite will transport you to the Italian countryside.","descriptionHTML":"<p>Bruschetta, or to some, “broo-sketta,” is one of those foods that’s just as fun to say as it is to eat.
