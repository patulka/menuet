Crispy, cheesy, and comforting—it’s a classic for a reason. Luckily, ours is as easy to make as it is to gobble up—that’s right, no frying required! Chicken is coated in a Tuscan-spiced panko crust, baked to golden perfection, then sprinkled with mozzarella and popped back into the oven to get all melty. While that comes together, you’ll whip up a homemade marinara sauce with flecks of fresh basil to toss with twirly spaghetti. If you can believe it, all of this awesomeness is ready in less than 45 minutes. Make your (real or imaginary!) nonna proud with this Italian-inspired feast.","descriptionHTML":"<p>What’s not to love about chicken parm? Crispy, cheesy, and comforting—it’s a classic for a reason.
