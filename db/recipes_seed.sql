1. Place your chicken into a roasting pan or dutch oven. I left the organs and the neck for added flavor.
2. Put garlic cloves under the skin of the chicken
3. Chop the onion and scatter around the bottom of the pan. Pour in water.
Salsa Verde
1. Remove the hulls from the tomatillos. They will be sticky, don''t worry if you can''t wash it all off. Remove the stems.
2. Place all the tomatillos and chiles into a sauce pot. Cover with water and boil until soft.
3. Remove the tomatillos and chiles from the water and place in a blender. Add all the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.
4. It''s as simple as that. A yummy salsa perfect for tamales, eating with chip or putting on top of whatever you''re eating!
Tamale Dough (Masa)
Mix all together to make a soft, sticky dough.
Salsa Verde Tamales
Tamale Dough
Shreded chicken
2 cups Salsa Verde
10 to 40 green olives
4 medium potatoes
1. Remove the corn husks from the bag and place them in a pot of hot water. Continue to heat on low for   at least 30 minutes. You want them to be pliable.
2. Add your shreded chicken to a skillet and cover with  about two cups of salsa verde.
3. If you have large olives you will want to cut them in 1/2 or in 1/4. If they are small you might just want to leave them whole. I prefer to remove the pit but you don''t have too, just watch out when you bit into the tamale. Place in small bowl and set aside.
4. Cut the potatoes into small, thick strips. You don''t have to remove the peel.  I used red potatoes because that is all I had. Normally I would use  regular old potatoes. Place in a small bowl, cover with water  to previent them from turning brown and set aside.
5. Now comes the fun part! Asembling the tamales! It is best to do this with a firend. My sister helped me since I am visiting her right now. Remove the soaked corn husks from the pot.
6. Pick out the husk you want to use. Normally one big one is enough. If the are small you may have to use two, overlapping a bit.
7. Spred about 2TBS of the dough across the bottom half of the husk, narrow end pointing away from you about 1/8 in thick. Going a little more than half way up, leaving a tiny bit of room on the sides.
8. Now place a small amount of chicken in the middle of the dough. I can''t remember the exact amount I used.
9. Place a potatoe sclice in the middle of the chicken and an olive at the end.
10. Fold in one side and then the other. Fold up the bottom. If you want you can tie them closed with a small strip of husk. I don''t.
11. In a large pot pour in a about two cups of water. Place as many tamales that will fit in the pot, open end facing up. Place the lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, turn down the heat and steam for 30 to 45 minutes.
12. Remove from the pot and enjoy!! You will know that they are done when the husk can be pulled away from the masa and not stick. I served mine with refried beans and rice. The rice recipe will soon to follow, hopefully! This recipe made almost 4 dozen tamales. They can be frozen to save for later.

Meanwhile, peel and devein the shrimp, keeping the heads and hulls. Set the shrimp aside in cold water. In the large "gumbo pot" boil heads and hulls for 30 minutes to an hour. This will give you Creole gumbo. Strain shrimp heads and hulls from stock and set aside. Discard heads and hull immediately. Otherwise, the next day your kitchen will smell like Bayou St. John.
Clean the fresh crabs  If the crabs are fresh, you must take time to clean them. Discard the hard back shell and some of the so-called "dead man," or yellow insides. Clean and separate crabs and set aside. (Note: If necessary, you can use meat from king, Dungeness, snow or stone crabs for your gumbo).
Before you fire up the stove again, cut up your celery, parsley, peppers, onions and garlic, especially if you''re alone and there is no one to help you stir the pots. It takes time peeling the onions and garlic  Put the celery and parsley in a separate container from the other chopped ingredients and refrigerate until needed to keep them fresh.
Place the gumbo pot with the shrimp stock on the stove. Add cleaned crabs and bay leaves. Stir slowly. You don''t want your shrimp stock messing up the floor. Add celery, parsley, and tomato paste to the gumbo brewing on the stove. Bring to a boil. Turn down heat, cover, and let simmer.
Here comes the roux -- a thick and flavorful sauce that has become one of the most important staples of Louisiana cuisine. Pour oil or shortening into a separate heavy skillet (please do not use a thin omelet pan) over a medium-low heat. Slowly stir in flour to make the roux. Keep your eyes on the skillet. If the phone rings, let the answering machine pick it up. Cook roux until it has a dark mahogany color. Do not stop stirring until roux appears nutty or grainy. If black specks appear, the roux is burned. Throw it out and start from scratch. A good roux could take 30 to 45 minutes cooking time.
Now you are ready to add the holy trinity of onions, garlic, and green peppers to the roux mixture. Stir ingredients in slowly because the flour is still sizzling. The moisture will begin to disappear. This is when Jean would add another quart or two of water to the gumbo pot. Add roux to the gumbo pot. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Lower heat and cover. The kitchen should smell good right now. Pour yourself another cold something-or-other. You''re halfway there. Come back to look and stir in an hour or so.
Season to taste: add salt, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and any Creole seasoning you like. Don''t overdo it right now. Let the roux work its magic absorbing all the wonderful ingredients. Gumbo is usually very spicy, but you can keep it mild. Remember, if you have decided to use andouille sausage it is also hot.
Fry sausages and okra with a little bit of the leftover grease. Sprinkle a little leftover flour if the okra is fresh. Add to gumbo pot. Add chopped peeled tomatoes, stirring until well blended. Add more water if necessary. The roux will keep it thick and tasty. Return to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and let simmer, uncovered, for 2 1/2 to 3 hours over low heat.
Skim any excess fat. Add shrimp. Stir in slowly as you increase the heat one last time. It''s time to stir in the fil powder. Cook another 20 to 30 minutes until the gumbo is thick. Taste and adjust seasonings one more time. Did I mention the rice? Seafood gumbo is served over Louisiana rice. Of course, you can substitute for your own favorite rice. Just plain old brown or white rice will do. Before serving, taste one more time and adjust seasoning. Turn off heat and remove seafood gumbo from the stove.
To cool down the pot before serving, place it in the sink with a few inches of ice-cold water. If needed, add additional salt and Tabasco sauce. If you can see through the gumbo to the bottom of the pot, work on your roux next time.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/Z2KPLCN3/jean-s-seafood-gumbo', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'shrimp

Set aside.
Peel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.
Remove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don''t worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don''t put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.
Now it''s time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.
Tightly roll the leaf into a bundle.
Run your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.
Don''t worry if it''s not perfect. Set aside the kale.
In a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.
Once the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.
Then add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.
With a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.
Now it''s time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.
Cook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread.

You can either spoon it out like a mad man, carefully remove it and cut it into squares, or scoop it all out with a melon baller-which is what I did.  I liked the look of all those succelent balls of watermelon.
So, scoop out your watermelon and put it in a bowl-I used the leftover water melon rind for my bowl, and youre going to add your dressing, which is so simple, soooo easy.
Make the Salad Dressing:  Add your oil, and vinegar.  No salt necessary as the feta is salty.
Mix this all together and chill for 15 minutes, which will give you time to prep your mint.
Chiffanade the mint, which means cut it into fine ribbons. Roll up the mint leaves like a cigar and then cut it into nice strips or ribbons. I had my daughter and her friend do this for me; they are 10 so you can see how easy this is.
Next crumble over with that delicious creamy feta cheese. The salty contrast with the sweet melon is so crazy good that it is hard to describe.
To finish add the fresh mint, which brings it all together. And a little more black pepper at the end so theres a little on the feta.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/5PWYQFFJ/watermelon-feta-and-mint-salad', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'watermelon

Chop the almonds. I did a rough chop and tried to chop them different ways so you get a different size bite each time.
Once you have the nuts chopped and your marshmallows measured out get the ice cream maker bowl out of the freezer and put it in the ice cream maker. Set it up so it is ready to use. Take your chocolate mixture out of the freezer and pour it into the ice cream maker. Turn the ice cream maker on. Set your timer for 35 minutes.
At the 35-minute mark add in your toppings and let it incorporate for another 5 minutes.

In a small bowl combine the graham crumbs, sugar and melted butter.
Press into the bottom of a lightly greased springform pan. (Grease bottom only! I also like to line the bottom with parchment paper for easy release of the cheesecake from the pan when it has cooled.)
To prepare the cheesecake
In a double boiler, melt together the  cup whipping cream and 1 cup pf white chocolate chips. You want this just at the melting point, so be careful not to overheat it. Let it cool to lukewarm if necessary after melting. Set aside to cool while you prepare the rest of the cheesecake batter.
Cream together the cream cheese and  cup sugar for a few minutes, scraping the bowl often.
Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.
Stir in the vanilla extract and melted white chocolate.
Finally blend in the 1 cup of whipping cream until smooth.
Pour over the prepared base and bake in a bain marie (See Note) at 325 degrees F for 60 to 70 minutes. The cheesecake may be beginning to lightly brown at the edges but a cheesecake does not need to brown at all to be fully baked. The surface of the cheesecake should lose any shine when the cake is properly baked. It can still be slightly wobbly just at the center at this point.
Remove the cake from the oven and run a sharp knife completely around the edge of the pan. This will allow for the cheesecake to shrink as it cools and hopefully not crack (but who cares if it does? I am never bothered by a crack or two in the surface)
Allow the cheesecake to cool thoroughly on a wire rack at room temperature. (Do not put a hot cheesecake into the fridge to cool quickly, this may result in an under baked cheesecake because the residual heat actually continues to set the cheesecake after it comes out of the oven).
To finish the cheesecake
When completely cool cover the top with fresh raspberries and garnish with melted white chocolate if desired.
Chill completely in the refrigerator until ready to serve.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/3VJQ5HQW/white-chocolate-cheesecake-with-raspberries', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'graham cracker crumbs

Grease a large 11 X 15 rimmed baking dish. (You could use two smaller dishes.) Pour the pudding mixture into the pan and place it in the oven. Lightly tent the pan with foil.
Bake for 1 hour, until the center is just set. (30-40 minutes for smaller pans) You may want to take the foil off the last 10-15 minutes so the top will be golden.

Toss gently in the sugar, cinnamon and lemon. Leave to soften for 10 minutes or so. Arrange in a layer on top of the custard. Start by laying overlapping apple slices all the way round the edge. Next create the ''rose'' - arrange the slices in a spiral, standing the apple slices a little on their edge, until the centre hole is completely filled in. Save the smallest, thinnest pieces for the very centre as they will have to bend the most.

Melt the sugar in a small saucepan over medium-high heat and cook until rich and golden. Add the butter and salt and stir to combine. Add the cream and continue to cook, stirring constantly, until the ingredients have formed a smooth, unified caramel. When the tart looks nearly ready, remove it from the oven and brush with the glaze. Return to the oven and cook for a further few minutes until the glaze is gently bubbling.

To prepare hard boiled eggs, place eggs in a saucepan, cover with cold water and bring to a boil over medium heat. As soon as the water comes to a full boil, let the eggs boil for 5 minutes, and then remove from heat and let stand covered in hot water 10 minutes .

Place a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).
Pour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don''t worry, you''ll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.
Cook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it''s slightly golden, it''s time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you''re using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it''s starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.
I usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.
To keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here''s a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.
So, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.
When you''re done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/QF2D46MW/buckwheat-galette-with-an-egg', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'milk

Season the chicken with salt and pepper and heat the olive oil in a large saut pan.

Saut the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil in a pan over medium high heat for just a couple minutes. Mix the peppers, corn and black beans in a bowl.
Lay out the egg roll wrappers. Smear some of the cilantro lime pesto on the end closest to you, leaving about an inch of the wrapper on the very end.
Add a spoon full of the veggies along the line of pesto. Brush the ends of the wrapper with water, this will help seal the egg roll. Fold the end nearest you over the veggies and the two
sides fold in as well.
Roll up the wrapper to the end. Place seam side down on a lined baking sheet that his been brushed with a bit of olive oil to prevent sticking.

You will be making these cookies one at a time. Drop one cookie into the melted chocolate mixture. Use a fork to flip it once, so both sides are now coated. Use the fork to lift the cookie out of the chocolate mixture, and run the bottom of the fork along the edge of the bowl, wiping off the extra drips of chocolate. Set coated cookie down on parchment lined baking tray.  Repeat, until youve coated all the cookies.  You can let them set at room temperature, but I speed up the process by sticking them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, till set.  Once the cookies have set, store them in an airtight container, between layers of parchment or wax paper. Keep them in the fridge, or, for longer-term storage, keep them in the freez</li></ol>', 'http://www.foodista.com/recipe/LHZ3Y2XD/allergy-free-thin-mints', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'baking powder

Chop the cauliflower into small pieces and pulse them in a food processor until it looks like rice. I usually pulse the cauliflower florets and the stalk together.
Place the olive oil in a saut pan over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the garlic and let it fry for about a minute or two, or until the garlic starts to brown. Add the pulsed cauliflower rice and cook it for about 2-3 minutes. The cauliflower should turn into a vibrant yellow-orange color when it is cooked. Add a pinch of salt and chopped basil to the cauliflower and stir.
Spiralize the zucchini with Blade B to create zucchini noodles. If you do not have a spiralizer, just create zucchini ribbons with a vegetable peeler.
To assemble the wraps, place a large leaf flat down. Add a bit of sauted cauliflower, zucchini noodles, red pepper, and avocado along the swiss chard stalk. Drizzle a bit of vinaigrette on top of the vegetables and wrap everything up.
Enjoy these wraps as a side to your favorite protein! Feel free to dip these wraps in more sauce.

Stir wet ingredients into dry ingredients using a spoon or spatula.  Batter will be somewhat lumpy -- do not over mix it to make it smooth.  Using an ice cream scoop (1/4 cup), fill paper liners.  Bake about 16 minutes, or till a toothpick inserted near center returns with just a few crumbs.  Cool in pan 5 minutes, then turn cupcakes out onto wire rack to completely cool.</li><li>PEANUT-BUTTER FILLING:  In small bowl, combine all ingredients.  Core cooled cupcakes with a Cuisipro or other hollowing device, and fill cavity with peanut butter filling.  Eat the cupcake pieces you cored; sandwich two with some peanut butter filling and marshmallow frosting.</li><li>MARSHMALLOW FROSTING:  In a small saucepan fitted with a candy thermometer, bring water, corn syrup and 1/3 cup plus 1 Tbsp. sugar to a rolling boil on high heat, brushing down sides of pan with a wet pastry brush.  Do not stir mixture, as it will cause it to crystallize.  Boil until mixture reaches 242F, or soft-ball stage.</li><li>In the meantime, a few minutes after the sugar mixture comes to a boil, in a completely clean, dry mixing bowl.  Using regular beaters on medium-high speed whip egg whites, vanilla powder or extract, salt and cream of tartar until creamy and foamy, about 2 minutes.  With mixer still on, sprinkle the remaining 1 Tbsp. of sugar over the whites and continue beating until whites hold very soft peaks, another 2 minutes.  When syrup has reached 242F, reduce mixer speed to low.  Find the sweet spot (between the sides of the bowl and the beaters) and very, very slowly and carefully drizzle in the hot syrup.  After all syrup has been added, turn mixer to high and beat till thick, fluffy and just barely warm, about 7 minutes.  Fit a 16" piping bag with a 1M Wilton tip; spoon frosting into bag and pipe onto cupcakes making high mounds of frosting.</li><li>GARNISHES:  Place chocolate into one bottom corner of a resealable plastic bag.  Microwave on high about 30 seconds.  Continue microwaving on high at 10-second intervals until chocolate is melted.  Very carefully cut the tiniest corner to make a very small hole through which the chocolate may be drizzled onto the frosting.  Lightly sprinkle peanuts over cupcakes.</li><li>TIME-SAVING TIPS:  Instead of making peanut butter filling, just use Peanut Butter & Co.''s White Chocolate Wonderful Peanut Butter.  If you''re not lactose intolerant, you could use a cake mix for the cupcakes, but you will have to double the other ingredients.</li></ol>', 'http://www.foodista.com/recipe/7PSYMB8V/dairy-free-cocoa-cupcakes-with-peanut-butter-filling-marshmallow-frosting', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'baking powder

Preheat broiler. Select firm, meaty peppers without wrinkles for roasting. Wash thoroughly. Place peppers evenly in a single layer on a foil-lined cookie sheet. Place under broiler. Watch them closely as the skin will blister and turn black within minutes. Turn the peppers after 5 minutes to blister all sides evenly. When done, the pepper skins should be evenly blistered and mostly black. Place roasted peppers in a plastic bag, cover with a kitchen towel and when cool, rub off blackened skin. Tear open and pull out the seed pod and stem.
Sauce
In a blender combine the peppers, flour, and half of the suero or buttermilk and blend until creamy. Pour mixture into medium skillet and set over medium-low heat to warm. Add additional suero or buttermilk and stir. Taste and season with salt, usually about 2 teaspoons. If the sauce is too spicy, add  cup of crema or sour cream and stir. If the sauce is too thick, add water until desired consistency is reached.
Chicken (Optional)
In a pot with enough water to cover, boil chicken breasts 25 minutes or until juices run clear. Drain, cool, and shred. Optional time-saver: shred a store bought rotisserie chicken.
Stacked Style
Fry tortillas in hot oil until softened. Drain on paper towels. Soften tortillas by soaking in sauce one at a time. Place softened tortillas on individual serving plates. Layer with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Repeat process for a total of 3 tortillas for each serving.
Oven Style
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread 1 cup of the sauce in an ungreased 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Fry tortillas in hot oil just until softened. Drain on paper towels. Fill with cooked chicken, cheese, and onion. Roll, placing seam side down.

In a large bowl filled with water, dip a wrapper in the water. The rice wrapper will begin to soften and this is your cue to remove it from the water and lay it flat.

I usually give it a couple of swishes in the water and then remove. It may feel slightly stiff but by the time you are ready to roll up, the wrapper will become very pliable.  A typical spring roll contains cooked rice vermicelli, slivers of cooked pork and julienned carrots but you can use whatever suits your fancy.

If using a baggie, snip off about 1/4" of the corner and squeeze baggie to pipe out mousse into the hollowed section of the zucchini.

Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of finely chopped scallions or spring onions to the pork mixture. Combine all the filling ingredients well.
Thaw the dumpling wrappers if they are frozen. Keep them well covered until they are ready to be used.
Dust a dish generously with flour. This will hold the dumplings once they are made.
Dust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling.
Prepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper.
Bring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet. Gently push the filling into the wrapper and pinch the top tip of the dumpling wrapper to seal it.
From the centre of the dumpling, fold a pleat on ONE side and bring it to the other side of the dumpling. Fold towards the centre of the dumpling. Pinch to seal it.
Repeat and create a 2nd pleat. Be mindful to pinch tight to seal the dumpling well. Repeat and create a 3rd pleat. Each side should have 3 pleats.
Repeat the same pleating on the other end of the dumpling. Always ensure that the pleats face the centre of the dumpling.
Place all prepared dumplings in a well floured dish ensuring that they do not touch each other. Set aside till ready to cook. They can also be frozen at this stage.
To cook the potstickers, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan. The potstickers should be cooked in at least 2 batches.

Add 1/3 cup of water to the pan. Cover the pan immediately and let the steam cook the dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes.
Once the water has evaporated, remove the cover and let the dumplings sit in the hot pan for another minute for its base to crisp up again. These are now Chinese potstickers.
Gently transfer the potstickers to a plate. Serve immediately.

Over medium heat cook 4 strips of Bacon in the large heavy bottomed pot until crisp.  Remove from the heat and allow to drain on paper towels.  Later you will crumble the Bacon into the finished Sauce.  Reserve the Bacon Fat in the pot.
Dry off any moisture on your Beef Short Ribs using paper towel.  The meat will brown better and caramelize instead of steam if it is dry.  This browning will produce a lot of flavor in the finished dish.
Cut the Short Ribs into 3-4 inch sections.  Trim some of the excess outer fat, leaving some for flavor.  Season the Short Ribs with Sea Salt and Black Pepper.
Over medium high add 3 T of Olive Oil to the Bacon Fat and brown all sides of the Short Ribs until they get a good dark brown sear.  Give the Short Ribs room between each other so they do not steam and brown properly.  You will have to do this in 2 to 3 batches to brown all the Short Ribs well.   You will not be cooking through all the way, just browning at this stage.  The Short Ribs will be raw in the middle.
Place the first batch after browning in a bowl to catch any drippings.
After all the Short Ribs are browned well, remove them from the pot and set aside in the large bowl to collect any drippings as they sit.  Next remove the used Bacon Fat and Olive Oil from the pot leaving any of the cooked on bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.  Reduce the heat to medium and add 3 T of fresh Olive Oil and saute the sliced Mushrooms until browned and crisp. 7-10 minutes.
Then over medium heat add the diced Onions and Carrot and saute until soft, 5-7 minutes.  Add the minced Garlic and cook for 1 minute more.
Deglaze the pot by adding 2 cups of Cabernet Sauvignon.  As soon as you add the Wine increase the heat to high and stir rapidly, scraping the bottom of the pot releasing the cooked on brown bits stuck to the bottom.  Bring to the boil then add 2 cups of Beef Stock and the Tomato Paste, Beef Base, Thyme, Bay Leaves, Sea Salt and Black Pepper.  Allow to boil, stirring continuously for 3 minutes.
Add the Beef Short Ribs and any juices that collected in the bowl to the boiling pot.  Put them in snugly against each other and boil for 2 minutes.
Then place the lid on the pot and place in the center of the oven and cook for 3 hours at 300 degrees undisturbed.  Don''t peek and release the moist heat that will make these Short Ribs fall of the bone.
After 3 hours remove from the oven and take off the lid.  Prepare for a steam facial!  Remove the Cooked Beef Short Ribs to a large bowl.  Be gentle, it will be falling off the bone.  Allow the Sauce to sit for 3 minutes so the fat rises to the top.  Skim off the fat using a large spoon and discard it.  Remove as much as you can.  Remove the Bay Leaves and stems from the Thyme if you used fresh Thyme.
Remember, the pot is HOT, it just came from the oven!!!  Use pot holders and place the pot of defatted Sauce over medium high heat and bring to a boil, stirring frequently, and reduce by a third.  This will concentrate the Sauce into a rich incredible Sauce. Taste the Sauce and add Sea Salt and or Black Pepper is needed at this point.  Crumble the Bacon and add to the Sauce stirring in well.
Add the Beef Short Ribs back to the pot of reduced Sauce and remove from the heat.  Coat the Short Ribs in the Sauce well.  Serve Immediately over Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes or Polenta.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/8VJB2NF5/amazing-braised-beef-short-ribs', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'bacon

In a large bowl sift together flours, sugar and salt. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the bowl. Rub the butter into the flour mixture with your hands until the pieces are small but still visible.
Add oil and yogurt to the bowl and stir with a fork to combine. Knead the dough for one minute in a bowl. It will still be fairly crumbly. Transfer to a floured surface and continue to knead until you can form a ball of dough. Divide the dough in half and flatten into two discs. Wrap in cellophane and refrigerate at least one hour.
While the dough chills, create the filling. Add all ingredients to a food processor and pulse until smooth. Refrigerate until ready to use.
Preheat oven to 400. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.
When the dough is chilled, remove from the fridge and unwrap. Flour a large, smooth surface. Roll both balls of dough until they are each about  inch thick. Use a cookie cutter to cut heart shapes or use a biscuit cutter/large glass to cut circles.
Place half of the pie hearts onto the prepared cookie sheet and add one teaspoon of pie filling to the centre of each one.
I added personalized messages to each pie using letter stamps I bought at a craft store. I stamped love be mine and honey on the heart shaped dough that would act as the tops of the pies.
Wet your finger and paint it along the edges of each cut out. Place a second dough heart on top of the filling and press down along the edges to secure.
Use the tines of a fork and press down along the edges to contain the pie filling. Brush a small amount of egg white on the top of each pie. This will give a nice golden colour to the pies.
Bake for 20 minutes.

Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.
Begin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.
Reduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.
Rolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won''t look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.
Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/6FMXSM3N/beef-pot-pies-with-irish-cheddar-crust', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'unsalted butter

Cool 15 minutes and remove from pan and place on a cooling rack. Allow to cool completely.
Prepare the simple syrup glaze by placing all of the ingredients in a small pot and bringing to a boil. Boil about 3 minutes and remove from heat. Set aside to cool.
Prepare frosting by beating the softened cream cheese in a medium bowl until creamy and lump free. Add half the whipping cream and beat on low about 30 seconds.
Add half the powdered sugar and beat until all the sugar is mixed in.
Add remaining whipping cream and beat until creamy.
Add the last of the powdered sugar and beat well, about 2 minutes. Add almond extract and beat for about 30 seconds.
Turn the mixer on high and beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.
Assemble the cake
Trim any uneven parts off the top of your first layer by sawing a serrated knife along the top until the top is level.
Place on a cake stand or plate. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the cake with an even layer of the simple syrup.  Trim the second layer of cake and place on a cooling rack. Brush with simple syrup and set aside. Discard any left over syrup.
Allow syrup to soak into the cake layers for about 5 or 10 minutes.
Spread about a cup of frosting over the top of the first cake layer to about a  inch from the edge. Spread a layer of cherry pie filling over the frosting to about an  inch from the edge of the frosting.
Carefully place the second layer of cake on top of the first layer being careful not to put too much pressure on the filling. You dont want the filling to start to ooze out from the sides of the cake.
Take about 1 cup of frosting out of the bowl and put it into a smaller bowl. This is to prevent the chocolate crumbs from the cake to get into the bowl of frosting.
You dont want flecks of cake in your white frosting.
Spread a thin but even layer of frosting on the sides of the cake. Be sure to fill the space between both cake layers with frosting. This will trap the filling between both cake layers.
Frost the top of the cake with a thin layer of frosting.
Chill for about an hour to set the frosting.
Remove the cake from the refrigerator and spread the remaining frosting over the sides and top.
Form an edge in the frosting on the top of the cake by pushing down into the frosting and building up a ledge of frosting with a small spatula along the edge of the cake.
You may have to even out the frosting in the center by removing a thin layer  of frosting until the edges are higher then the center of the cake.
Add cherry pie filling to the top filling in the center of the frosting.

In the meantime, dry roast the cinnamon stick, black cardamom seeds, green cardamom seeds, pepper corns and cloves. Pound them to a powder (not very fine).
In a mortar and pestle grind the green chillies to a paste. (Using a pinch of coarse salt will help)
Mix all the ingredients together and your marinade is ready.
Ensure that you pat dry the chicken cubes.
Transfer the chicken in a bowl
Add the marinade to the chicken cubes and mix it well so that all pieces are well coated.
Cover the bowl with a cling film and put it in the refrigerator.
Leave the chicken to marinate over-night. (I marinated for almost 18 hours and the result was moist and tender chicken tikkas)
For Grilling:
I grilled these tikkas in my non-stick grill pan. Using a non-stick pan helped me keep the amount of oil to minimal.
Soak the skewers in water for at least half an hour before you intend to serve them.
Now take the skewers and start skewering the chicken pieces on them. I leave a little space in between the chicken pieces; else they stick together and do not get cooked well. (Perhaps the reason could be pan grilling)
Keep the skewers ready and then heat the pan (medium hot).
You can use an oil spray or pour a little oil using a spoon in a linear fashion across the grill pan.
Place the skewers over the oiled pan and grill them on medium low heat.
It will take approximately 45 seconds to a minute for one side to get cooked.
Then turn around and cook the other side the same way.
Serve them hot as a starter or as a main course with Bakarkhani!! Bon apptit!!', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/GV8J2V28/saffron-chicken-tikka', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'chicken breasts

Beat on high for about 5 minutes until the mixture is fluffy and smooth. Add the powdered xylitol and mix well. Add peppermint extract and coloring if desired, and beat until all incorporated. Once the mixture is perfectly fluffy and creamy, add the flour and mix until just combined. The mixture should be thick and smooth but still easy to spread. Spread the mixture evenly over the cooled brownies and place in the fridge for 10 minutes, until the mint filling has firmed.</li><li>Next, melt the chocolate. Add the oil to the melted chocolate and stir to combine. Remove the brownies from the fridge and pour the melted chocolate over the brownies, gently and quickly spread the chocolate evenly over the brownies. The mint filling should be cold so the warm chocolate doesnt melt the mint filling, but the chocolate will cool quickly once it touches the cold mint. Make sure to work quickly so the chocolate layer will be even. Return the brownies to the fridge to cool for another 5 minutes until the chocolate is set.</li><li>Cut the brownies after the 5 minutes with a sharp knife. Serve brownies chilled or at room temperature. Store any left overs in an airtight container in the refrigerator.</li><li>NOTE: Once the chocolate layer has firmed, be sure to cut all the brownies immediately with a sharp knife. I cut some of the brownies when they were really, really cold, and they didnt cut clean and pretty.</li><li>*For those who are not concerned with gluten content, wheat or white flour would work okay as well. For wheat, decrease the amount by 1 tablespoon. For the filling, be sure to use a white color flour to keep the mint filling a bright pretty green color.</li><li>**You can use any kind of chocolate you like, but dark chocolate gives a wonderful flavor to the peppermint and sugar free dark chocolate is the easiest to find.</li></ol>', 'http://www.foodista.com/recipe/JTC6D6KV/healthy-mint-brownies', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'almond milk

Soak 8 bamboo skewers in water for at least 30 minutes. Set aside.
To make the sauce:
Cut the top of the dried chili and shake out the seeds. Transfer them into a saucepan along with the prunes, broth, tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, molasses, garlic, pumpkin seeds, cumin, and oregano. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat and cook for 2 minutes; then lower the heat to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes more.
Using an immersion blender, puree the mixture until completely smooth. Return to the heat and simmer, uncovered, for another 15 to 20 minutes. (If you dont have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the sauce into a food processor, and process until smooth, working in batches; then return to the pot.) Set the sauce aside until ready to serve with the corndogs, or if you are making this ahead of time, once the sauce has cooled, transfer it to a container and refrigerate.
To prepare the corn dogs:
In a mixing bowl, combine the masa harina, cornmeal,  cup of the rice flour, baking powder, brown sugar, and salt and mix to combine. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well to combine. Add the rice milk and lime juice and mix to combine. The mixture should resemble a thick pancake batter; if more milk is needed, add by the tablespoonful. Cover and refrigerate the mixture if you are not going to be frying right away.
When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a saucepan until it registers 350F on a deep-frying thermometer. While the oil is heating, place the remaining rice flour on a paper plate and set aside. Cut each chicken sausage in half crosswise, to make eight pieces.
Roll each piece of sausage in the rice flour to lightly coat. Thread the moistened bamboo skewers through the sausage pieces, so that the tips of the skewers are not quite poking out the top. Holding it by its skewer, dip a floured sausage piece into the batter, until it is completely coated. Carefully lift the stick and hold it over the bowl for a few seconds, allowing any excess batter to drip off. Repeat with another skewer. Carefully place two corn dogs into the hot oil and cook until they are crusty on the outside, and dark golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain on paper towels and keep warm. Repeat with each skewered sausage, allowing the oil to return to 350F in between.

The lumpia wrappers are very tightly packed, so be careful when pulling them apart.  Spoon 1 Tbsp mixture on the lower edge of the wrapper leaving 1 inch edge. Begin to fold egg roll like an envelope: first, fold over the lower 1 inch edge over the filing, then the left edge, then the right edge, then roll up to the top edge. To seal the wrapper just moisten the top edge with water. I used the sauce I got from draining the cooked mixture.
Heat vegetable oil in a large, deep frying pan over medium high heat. Place egg roll one at a time into hot oil, with the seam down (this will keep it from unraveling) and then quickly turn the egg roll to ensure the skin crisp up and does not stick to other egg rolls in the pan. Adjust heat so that the oil is bubbling gently and not too vigorously around the egg rolls. Each egg roll will take about 5 minutes to cook. Shake the egg roll over the pan to help remove the excess oil. Place egg roll on layers of paper towels to drain.

Once your eggs are cooked and shells are removed, set up an assembly line with the beaten eggs, sausage meat and bread crumbs.
Now you''ll want to take about a 1/4 cup of the ground sausage, form a disk and begin to shape it around the hardboiled egg.
Take the sausage-covered egg and dip it in the beaten egg.
Roll the sausage-covered egg in the bread crumbs until it is generously coated.
The final step is to fry those eggs up!  Once all of your eggs are coated in the bread crumbs, heat up your oil over medium high heat.  You''ll know your oil is at the right temperature when you drop a few bread crumbs in the pot and it begins to sizzle.  Take care not to add the eggs to the oil to early - if the oil isn''t hot enough it will just saturate the bread crumbs and it won''t be as tasty.
Drop two eggs at a time in the hot oil and cook them until very golden brown, about 6-7 minutes.  Make sure you give the eggs enough time in the oil so the sausage fully cooks.

The water should be hot to the touch but not hot enough to burn you.
Process the almonds in a food processor until coarse almond meal is formed. Add the pecans and process until they are ground up into a coarse meal as well.
Drain the dates and use your hand to squeeze out excess water. Add the drained dates, cocoa powder, vanilla extract, agave nectar, and salt to the food processor. Process until a smooth paste forms.
Use a tablespoon measure to help you form the truffles. Pack a heaping tablespoon of the mixture into the tablespoon measure  really pack it in there. Use your fingers to slide the half-rounded ball out of the tablespoon measure, and then use your hands to form a tightly packed ball of truffle goodness. Be gentle with them  I found that they fall apart if you try to roll them into balls. It is best to squish them with your hand into perfect little spheres.
Form truffles until you use up all the mixture. The last bit that was not enough for a truffle went straight into my mouth. :)
If you choose to, gently roll the truffles in the toppings of your choice. I had some turtle crunch sprinkles, unsweetened coconut flakes, and extra cocoa powder. The cocoa powder definitely gives the the truffles an extra dark chocolate kick, so if you dont like the bitterness of the cocoa powder then dont use that as a topping.', 'https://www.foodista.com/recipe/5P3VR382/15-minute-healthy-dark-chocolate-truffles', 'Foodista.com – The Cooking Encyclopedia Everyone Can Edit', 'dates

Remove ribs from marinade. Scrape marinade from ribs with a rubber spatula and reserve. Grill ribs over a slow fire for about 40 minutes, turning frequently; fire should not flare up and burn them.
Place reserved marinade in a saucepan and add sugar and honey. Heat only until the sugar is dissolved. Brush on ribs and continue grilling about 20 minutes more, basting as often as necessary to keep ribs moist.
Slice ribs just before serving. To serve, put 2 to 3 tablespoons of sauce on a plate and lay 2 or 3 ribs on top.
