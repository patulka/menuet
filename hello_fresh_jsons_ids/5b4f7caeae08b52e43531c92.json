Season with salt and pepper.","timers":[],"images":[{"link":"https://d3hvwccx09j84u.cloudfront.net/0,0/5b4f7caeae08b52e43531c92/step-ce4d74f8.jpg","path":"/5b4f7caeae08b52e43531c92/step-ce4d74f8.jpg","caption":"Make Sauce"}],"videos":[],"ingredients":["554a3879fd2cb9ba4f8b456a","5566e4d74dab71e3078b4569","5632315bf8b25e5a138b4568","55eee003f8b25e7f6e8b4567","5566dc00f8b25e5b298b4568","5566ceb7fd2cb95f7f8b4567","554a3dfbf8b25e1d268b456f"],"utensils":["57e2674fb7e8697d4b305373"]},{"index":6,"instructionsMarkdown":"To pot with potatoes, add 2 TBSP butter, remaining sour cream, and ¼ cup milk (we sent more).
